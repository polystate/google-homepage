The Odin Project - Google Clone

Basic HTML/CSS attempt to make it look as close as possible from scratch. No frameworks/Grid/Flex used. I learned that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal, even for the simplest of objectives; and often times the best solution should be one that is planned out in advance when structuring the layout of your page before coding.

For example, there are multiple ways to center a div both vertically and horizontally, and whichever way you choose can have some ramifications.

I also forgot to --commit-- on some of my saves to show the timeline of changes that were made. That won't happen next time.
